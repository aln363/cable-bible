# [The Cable Bible](https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible)
A comprehensive guide to cables and connectors potentially used for audiovisual/media preservation. Now hosted on GitHub Pages, at https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible

You can also install the latest [release](https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible/releases) on your computer with the command:
```
brew install amiaopensource/amiaos/cable-bible
```
and then call it locally with the command:
```
cable-bible
```
This works currently under macOS, Linux and Windows Terminal and the Linux subsystem on Windows. On classic Windows you can install the last [release](https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible/releases) manually and the open `index.html` in a browser.

## Maintainers

- Ethan Gates (EG-tech)
- Dylan Lorenz (dylanlorenz) has been temporarily added as a project maintainer to facilitate contributions to the Cable Bible in a workshop scheduled for 11/27/2023. Maintainer permissions will be revisited shortly after this date.

## Contribute
Please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your own additions of modules for signal types, interfaces or connectors you think we're missing (there's a lot!)

If you're not comfortable working in GitHub, you can just supply the information and we'll be happy to add it! Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible/issues) or contact user EG-tech (Ethan Gates) with relevant descriptions, photos, info, etc.!

### A Note on Inclusive Language
"Traditional" electrical and mechanical trades have sorted cable connections and fasteners in terms of "Male" (to refer to a connector or plug featuring pins or protrusions) and "Female" (to refer to a connector or plug into which pins or protrusions are inserted). The creator and maintainers of the Cable Bible find this obvious reference to a limited, cis-gendered, heteronormative understanding of human genitalia, gender, and sexual intercourse to be at best inappropriate and unnecessary, and at worst a perpetuation of harmful biases in the world at large.

The Cable Bible avoids using these classifications on the live site whenever possible. Suggested contributions should limit explanation of connections to "pins", "plugs", "sockets" or similar non-gendered terms. Maintainers will edit and enforce these terms before accepting pull requests to the main branch.

Sample images uploaded to the Cable Bible source repository *do* use a naming convention to indicate whether they depict a connector or port with or without pins, for clearer organization and to ease editing of the main text. In this case, the creator opted to use the terms "Cork" (to refer to a connector or plug featuring pins) and "Bottle" (to refer to a connector or plug into which pins are inserted). Again, maintainers on this repository will enforce this non-gendered naming convention on suggested contributions before accepting any pull requests to the live branch.

We acknowledge that this may cause some confusion when using the Cable Bible as a reference or educational tool, since few similar steps have been taken by cable manufacturers, vendors, or the vast majority of electrical, mechanical and technical professionals. So, a connector labeled "cork" in the Cable Bible source code should be considered equivalent to a "Male" connector elsewhere, and a "bottle" connector should be considered equivalent to a "Female" connector elsewhere.
